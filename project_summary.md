## Description
Spirograph. Lorenz' strange attractors. It's in these lines, that I'm exploring graphics, as a result of animation. Since if you follow an object through time, and imagine it to draw a chalk line on the earth, you'll see lines. And by selecting the right object these lines may be ...interesting... and... beautiful!

## Link to Prototype
What I have in mind is a mixture of the following:

[The spectator](http://codepen.io/potatoDie/pen/BbFht "Happy puppy ignorant of trail")
[Drawing with light](http://codepen.io/potatoDie/pen/Kfpqx "The gravity aspect")

## Example Code
NOTE: Wrap your code blocks or any code citation by using ``` like the example below.
```
var G = 6.674e-11; // gravitational constant
```
