##Follow the car 

A quick test of a possible solution. Here the Ferrari races his own race. The pup lags behind sometimes. Here its
speed is animated. The idea is to connect the speed with the shoutbox.

The race element has moved to the background. Also there's just one team. Why are those people shouting? They encourage the pup to
chase the car, so the shape emerges.
