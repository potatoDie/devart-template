##Pushing boundaries 

The dilemma came back during the night. Along with this picture:

![Trees](project_images/trees.jpg?raw=true "Leaf")

Which tree do I prefer? (Hint: not _a_.)

That simply means I have to go back to the basic idea, although the context of this competition inspires 
to decorate the idea. I went along with that, but I renavigate.

At this moment I do not see an opportunity to make the idea technologically more interesting without
sacrificing the contemplativity of the graphic work. So I'm pushing the boundaries, but I'm pushing them back. Inwards. ~~Courageously.~~

That means I'm just proposing to hang a picture on the wall?

![Trees](project_images/zen.jpg?raw=true "Leaf")

Yes, I guess so.
