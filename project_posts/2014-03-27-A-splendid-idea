##The unobtrusive easel

Put the drawing on an easel! Or perhaps not. That's even more splendid. 

I'd like it if it sat just quietly on the wall. Unobtrusively, to use a technological term. Serene and approvingly. (I'd like to add that, since sometimes I think my proposal is so darned ridiculously lame, that it might look like I'm mocking the other competitors. That's not the truth. The truth is, I'm pretty envious of many projects and their creators.)

I'll round up tomorrow.
