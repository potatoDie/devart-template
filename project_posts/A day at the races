## Interaction after all

All gloominess set aside, let's not forget it should be fun! So the new setup includes interaction. Not only to the system, but also
(maybe annoyingly so) to/with the other visitors. 
At the same time connect lowbrow and a little higher brow culture. How? Read on.

An old fashioned race game. A red car, and a white one. Let's use a screen to display the track and the vehicles. 
Controls: Voice, sheer volume! (If anyone reading this says you can't do that, not in the Barbican, please let me know right away. That would save me
a lot of time, thank you!)

We can minimize the noise somewhat by using a shoutbox. It's a box with 1 or more holes in it, through which you can stick your head
to impress the microphone (which is also in the box). Fun thing is you cannot see the screen while your head is in the shoutbox,
so cooperation is vital (if the design allows for fast cars to miss corners). You could even build a control that would break
the car if you say 'ieh', instead of 'Vroammm'.

There's a shoutbox for each car.

What about the not-so-low cultural part?
There's a second screen on top of the race track. And this one displays spirographical imagery, based on the position/speed
of the car. Also depending on the shouting in the box.

So, you see, there's beauty in everything. Even in that horrible a capella motor noise.

How to create those upbrow graphics, is the next problem.
