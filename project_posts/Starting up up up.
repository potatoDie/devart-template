There isn't much time left. 5 days. So hurry!

I was already working on something before I heard of DevArt, so let's just go on with that idea. That idea is basically 
to let a point move over a surface, creating a line. The movement of the point is controlled by attractional forces. 
Gravity for instance. 

First step is to get a rough outline of how the basic idea of 'animated graphics' can be combined with the 
exhibition.

The graphics that are created are based on some sort of data. I have used a handdrawn SVG path, but you could use data 
instead from your sunday morning hike (e.g. recorded with Strava). Or use the path of a visitor of the exhibition.

###The dilemma. Representative random data vs. interaction
The first thing that comes to my mind when thinking of an exhibition, is that interaction is a must. The visitor pushes a button, or makes a gesture 
and the code reacts. But I have a preference for more random input. Following an insuspicious visitor through the building,
or a robot making his round, avoiding running into the human visitors (dressed up like security staff). So the data is
not random per se, but has a lot of randomness in it. 

It could also be data from another time, another place. I don't insist 
to stress
the here and now. Rather present a global view.
